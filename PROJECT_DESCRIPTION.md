# PlotGIS - Project Description

## Short Description (for GitHub repository)
Prototype real estate app with GIS mapping, custom polygon boundaries, and React Native UI. Browse and list properties with geographic coordinates in General Santos City. This is a proof-of-concept demo application.

## Key Features

### Precision Mapping
- **Custom Polygon Boundaries**: Properties displayed with polygon shapes instead of simple markers
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Basic zoom and pan controls for exploring properties
- **Location-based Filtering**: Filter properties by barangay

### Modern Development
- **React Native + Expo**: Cross-platform mobile app with hot reloading
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe development
- **Modern UI Patterns**: Clean design with smooth animations

### User Features
- **Property Creation**: Map-based location setting with polygon drawing
- **Image Galleries**: Browse property photos
- **Search & Filter**: Filter by title, address, and location
- **Document Preview**: Simulated document access

### Design Features
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, modern design
- **Category Colors**: Visual distinction between property types
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Smooth Interactions**: Basic animations and transitions

## Technical Highlights
- Built with Expo Router for navigation
- Uses react-native-maps for mapping
- Implements bottom sheets, modals, and drawer navigation
- Features custom polygon drawing tools
- Includes state management with React hooks

## Target Audience
- Students learning React Native development
- Developers interested in GIS mapping applications
- Anyone exploring real estate app concepts
- Demo for showcasing React Native capabilities

## Demo Information
This is a prototype application with simulated data. No actual backend or database is connected.

## Notes
This project serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating:
- React Native development with Expo
- GIS mapping integration
- Modern mobile UI patterns
- Property management interface concepts

It's designed for learning, demonstration, and as a starting point for more advanced real estate applications.
